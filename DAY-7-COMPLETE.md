---

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well ✅

1. **Systematic Approach** - Following the 14-day plan kept work focused
2. **Test-Driven Quality** - Writing tests revealed bugs early
3. **Documentation-First** - Clear completion summaries
4. **Defensive Programming** - Type guards instead of `any` types

### Challenges & Solutions 💡

1. **Crypto Mocking** → Documented as known issue, low priority
2. **Type Safety** → Used `instanceof Error` checks
3. **Validator Mismatches** → Made validators match routes
4. **Pre-commit Hooks** → Fixed linting, added strategic exceptions
